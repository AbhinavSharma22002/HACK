# Shastra ðŸ”±

Shastra is a form of software that protects people from specific illegal acts using a model of violent and non-violent behaviour and notifies higher authorities in cases of violence.

## Introducing our software that traces violence in the society

Register as a user to test our model

Once you get register, allow camera to record you and test our model

Now you must have perfomed some actions in front of webcamp to check our model, If you have perfomed some violence then in console it will show that confidence of violence is 
greater than confidence of Non-violence. Hence proved our model that it can detect violence and can be used anywhere.
